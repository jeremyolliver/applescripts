These are some applescript's I wrote to fulfill functions that were useful to me

folder_stalker
==============
Script for notifying via Growl (http://growl.info) notifier (or a finder popup dialog if Growl isn't installed) whenever files are added to whichever folder you choose to watch.

open_rails_project
==================
Script which streamlines a workflow for opening a project in the Terminal + TextMate and starting a rails console session in a new terminal tab (optionally also script/server)
